# Introduction

The traditional battleship game is an easy and fun two-player game. As engineers, we want to innovate the game with some technological taste. We designed a sound localization system which converts the traditional battleship game to a precision-based game. We call this new game “Acoustic Battleship” as the game is designed based on an acoustic localization system. Players attack their opponent’s board with a ping pong ball and our system determines the location where the ball lands based on the time of arrivals received by sensors placed around the board; LEDs then indicate hit or miss with distinct colors, based on pre-set target positions at the start of the game. The core of our project is to precisely record the time of arrivals at every sensor for each hit and to calculate the sound location using triangulation
